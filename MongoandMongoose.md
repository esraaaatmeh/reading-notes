# Readings: Mongo and Mongoose

1. Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

   | SQL                           | NoSQL                       |
   | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- |
   | Relational Databases          | Non-relational DataBase     |
   | Structured query language     | Unstructured query language |
   | Vertical scalable             | Horizontal scalable         |
   | Have predefined schema        | Dynamic schema              |
   | Can be used for complex query | Not good for complex query  |

   1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
      complex queries.

   1. Give a real world example.
      Sqlite
      Postgres
      MySql
      MS-SQL
      Oracle
   1. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
      -NoSQL databases are often better suited to storing and modeling structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data in one database
   1. Give a real world example.
      -MongoDB
      -Redis
      -Hbase
      -Cassandra
   1. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
      -NoSQL database.
   1. Which type of database is best for scalability?
      -NoSQL database.

1. What does SQL stand for?
   -Structured Query Language.
1. What is a relational database?
   -Database which works with certain assumptions or in a certain way and it supports SQL .

1. What type of structure does a relational database work with?
   -organizes data into rows and columns, which collectively form a table
1. What is a 'schema'?
   -the “blueprint” of a database which describes how the data may relate to other tables or other data models
1. What is a NoSQL database?
   -Non-relational DataBase
1. How does it work?
   -use collections instead of tables , collections have documents (can use different structures / no schema applied).
1. What is inside of a Mongo database?
   -collections, documents , many different data that are not applied to schema or relations.
1. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
   -MongoDB is more flexible, because you can store your data where ever you want because you don't have to follow a schema
1. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
   -It may have duplicated data
